# Tic-Tac-Toe
Game App with React, Babel and Webpack
I build a game app without create-react-app. You can check my simple file flow and which packge I used for this application.
Absolutely it depends on what would you like to use for your project like Sass or Styled component or simple css. I did not add typescript
but i wan to add it for my future projects.

## Commands 
yarn dev and yarn build

Thanks and Have Fun... :D
